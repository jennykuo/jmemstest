						<h2>Medieval/Renaissance: After Periodization</h2><BR>

This special issue rethinks traditional periodization of the "Middle Ages" and the "Renaissance" by bringing together work that crosses, reassesses, or explores alternatives to what Judith Bennett calls "the great divide." Such work might reexamine the idea of the Renaissance through its defining events: for example, the spread of humanism, the "fall of Constantinople," and the English and European Reformations. Reading comparatively, it might explore the uneven effects of historical change across nations and media (art history versus literary history; Spain versus England). It might illuminate stories left in the dark by traditional periodization, such as as late classical/Anglo-Saxon/early medieval transitions, continuities of "Catholic" religious practice in "Protestant" nations, or the trans-Atlantic Renaissance and other world-defining enterprises. Or it might examine how narratives of "development" or "progress" across periods play differently according to gender and class. By cutting across traditional period boundaries, we aim to encourage collaborative thinking between medievalists and early modern scholars on the interrelations between, and future of, their fields.					</TD>

The time is ripe for a multidisciplinary reevaluation of one of the oldest, and traditionally one of the most conservative, subfields in the modern discipline of history: the study of premodern diplomacy. Within the discipline of history itself, diplomatic studies are often bracketed aside from other areas of investigation and seem impermeable to theoretical and methodological innovations that have transformed almost every other sector of the discipline. Scholars interested in race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, subalternity, and new modes of intellectual history have occasionally used diplomatic sources, but they have rarely investigated the diplomatic practices that created those sources in the first place. The modern cross-disciplinary study of international relations has broadened the discussion of diplomatic issues for later historical periods, but the presentist biases of that conversation?centered on nineteenth-century understandings of the nation?have limited its application to the medieval and early modern periods. Current study in the wake of new historicism tends too much to emphasize power relationships within individual polities, so that relationships between and among polities have remained under-investigated and under-theorized.


      <p>  This special issue seeks to encourage more profound reflection on the cultural significance of diplomatic encounters in the medieval and early modern periods. Submissions might engage issues such as the following: the role of gender in diplomatic exchange and negotiation; queens as subjects and objects of diplomatic conversations; the training and education of ambassadors; the place of diplomacy in medieval and early modern literature, and the place of literature in early modern diplomacy; diplomacy, race, and ethnicity; diplomacy and discourses of secrecy; diplomatic literacy; the dispatch as genre; the ambassador as displaced person; queer diplomacy; diplomacy and the rise of the nation state; diplomacy East and West / North and South; diplomacy and rhetoric; diplomacy, manuscript culture, and print.				</h5>

For this open-topic issue of the journal, the editors invite articles that are both informed by historical inquiry and alert to issues raised by contemporary theoretical debate. We expect that essays will be grounded in an intimate knowledge of a particular past and that their argumentation reveal a concern for the theoretical and methodological issues involved in interpretation. We are particularly committed to work that seeks to overcome the polarization between "history" and "theory" in the study of premodern Western culture.<p>


        Note that submissions will be vetted as they are received, but final decisions for inclusion in this issue cannot be made until after the deadline for submissions.
