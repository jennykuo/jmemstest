<a name="manu"><h2><p><br><i>Preparation of Manuscript</i></p></h2></a>
<h5>
  <p>Submit two hardcopies of the 
    manuscript.  <br></p>
  <p>DOUBLE SPACE all materials, 
    including block quotations, notes, and captions for figures or illustrations.  </p>
  <p>All material in the document, 
    including extracts and endnotes, should be formatted in a 12-point Courier 
    (typewriter style) font (not in a proportional font like Times Roman).  </p>
  <p>Use 1.25&rdquo; margins on the 
    side; do not justify margins. </p>
  <p><u>Underline</u> to indicate 
    italics; do not use an italic font.  </p>
  <p>Do not use the special character 
    em-dash for dashes, but rather use two hyphens to indicate a dash.  </p>
  
<p>The journal follows <i>The 
  Chicago Manual of Style</i> (14th ed. [or new 15th ed.]) in most matters 
  of style. Notes are to be formatted according to the guidelines in chapter 
  15 [16], humanities style, <i>not MLA style</i>. Be sure publishers 
  are included with book citations. For pre-1900 imprints, only the place 
  of publication is required. </p>
  <p>Primary sources, after being 
    documented in the notes upon first citations, may be cited parenthetically 
    in-text thereafter. Document secondary sources only in the notes. After 
    initial citation of secondary sources, a short form of citation may 
    be used thereafter (see <i>CMS</i> 15.252-61 [16.41-42]).  </p>
  <p><i>Endnotes</i>: notes must 
    be placed at the end of the article, double-spaced, with no extra space 
    between notes. An acknowledgment note, if used, should be unnumbered 
    and placed at the beginning of the notes. Do NOT strip the notes from 
    the text; the autonumbering function must be preserved during editing.  </p>
  <p>Notes must be automatically 
    formatted by your software so that they are moveable and able to be 
    renumbered automatically after any addition or deletion. Do not submit 
    notes in a separate file. Avoid cross-referencing in the notes unless 
    absolutely necessary.  </p>
  <p>Superscript note numbers in 
    the text; in the endnotes, do not put a PERIOD after note numbers.  </p>
  <p>The Latin abbreviations cf., 
    e.g., et al., i.e., and ibid. are not italicized and should be confined 
    to parentheses and notes. Note that the abbreviations inf., loc. cit., 
    op. cit., and sup., whose referents are indeterminate or difficult to 
    locate, should not be used.  </p>
  <p>Follow old-style abbreviations 
    of states, <i>CMS </i>14.17 [15.29]. </p>
  <p>For inclusive numbers, follow <i>
    
    CMS</i> 8.68-69 [9.62-64].  </p>
  <p>For use of ellipses, follow <i>
    CMS</i> 10.52-63 [11.57-58], and for permissible changes in quotations 
    10.7 [11.8].  </p>
  <p><i>Foreign or special characters</i> 
    should be obtained through a PC Extended Character Set. Special characters 
    obtained through nonstandard printer setups will &ldquo;translate&rdquo; on 
    our computer system into arbitrary symbols. If you must use characters 
    not obtainable through one of the Extended Character Sets (such as Middle 
    English yogh [all other Old and Middle English special characters are 
    obtainable in the ECS in lower case and capital], Greek, Hebrew, or 
    Arabic), print them any way you can, but include a memo notifying us 
    of their presence and a legend of all such characters used in the article; 
    they will have to be set by hand by people unfamiliar with these languages.  </p>
  <p>In general, languages that 
    do not use the Latin alphabet, especially those that are read from right 
    to left, should be transliterated for the journal&rsquo;s wide audience. 
    Again, because of our desire to make the journal readable for a broad 
    audience, include translations where needed in brackets, not in quotation 
    marks, immediately following the original. <br></p>
  <p>Format any lists or tables 
    in a consistent manner and as close as possible to the way you wish 
    for them to appear in print.  </p>
  <p><i>Citing primary sources</i>  </p>
  <p><i>JMEMS </i>
    articles typically feature many citations of primary sources. Keep in 
    mind that while certain short-forms of reference may be clear to specialists 
    in one particlular field, <i>JMEMS</i> readers range across many fields 
    and periods, and so these references need to be clear to nonspecialists 
    too. The following should be observed when citing primary sources:  </p>
  <p>(a) At first mention of primary 
    sources in the notes, spell out the titles (e.g., Gregory of Nazianzus, <i>
      Contra Galilaeos</i>), and then use abbreviated forms afterwards (<i>C. 
        Gal.</i>).  </p>
  <p>(b) Supply full citations of 
    editions used for primary sources that are quoted, discussed, or analyzed; 
    for primary sources merely referred to in the notes and not discussed, 
    then editions need not be cited. </p>
  <p>(c) After primary sources are 
    cited at first mention in the notes, then subsequent references should 
    be given parenthetically in the text using book/chapter/line refs. as 
    appropriate for a given work. IF such refs. are adequate for locating 
    cited material in an edition, then page numbers in the edition need 
    not be given; but if page numbers are needed, supply those as well. 
    If a quotation is given in the original and in translation, the translation 
    should be cited along with the edition, and the page ref. in the translation 
    supplied if book/chapter/line refs. are not adequate. If a translation 
    is your own, this should be stated. </p>
  <p>(d) Because there is so much 
    variation in how primary source citations are given, at first mention 
    in the notes, state what information will be supplied in further citations 
    of a work (e.g., &ldquo;Further citations will be given parenthetically 
    in the text by book and chapter numbers, along with page numbers in 
    the translation&rdquo;).  </p>
  
<p>(e) Consult recent issues of <i>
  JMEMS</i> for illustrative examples. </p>
  
<p><i>Quoting primary sources 
  and translations</i> </p>
  <p>Because there are various formats 
    used for quotations of primary sources and translations, it is necessary 
    for consistency that authors follow house style. The following should 
    be observed for <i>JMEMS</i>: </p>
  <p>(a) Both foreign language and 
    English quotations should be enclosed within quotation marks, and foreign 
    language should not be underscored. </p>
  
<p>(b) If a complete translation 
  is supplied after an original language quotation, the translation is 
  given within brackets (not parentheses) and without using quotation 
  marks. If a translation is given first and followed by the original 
  language, then the translation is enclosed within quotation marks and 
  the original in brackets and in roman. </p>
  <ul><p>Gregory had been instantly 
    gripped by &ldquo;an overwhelming desire for the beauty of tranquility and 
    retreat&rdquo; [eros tou kalou tes hesychias kai tes anachoreseos] (<u>Or</u>. 
    2.5-6). </p></ul>
  <p>(c) If foreign language words 
    or phrases are interpolated within a translation, these should be placed 
    within brackets and should not be underscored. <br></p>
  <ul><p>Gregory begins his argument 
    by challenging Julian&rsquo;s mistaken notion that &ldquo;to use Greek words 
    [hellena logon] is a matter of belief, and not simply of language [tes 
    glosses]&rdquo; (<u>Or</u>. 4.5). <br></p></ul>
  <p>(d) Other types of editorial 
    insertions in quotations of original language or translation should 
    be placed within brackets. <br></p>
  
<p>(e) Consult recent issues of <i>
  JMEMS</i> for illustrative examples. </p>
