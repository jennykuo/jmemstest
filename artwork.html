<a name="artwork"><h2><p><br><i>Artwork</i></p></h2></a>
			<h5><p>The following guidelines will help artwork, diagrams,  figures, and other images to appear sharp in printed form. With a proliferation  of ways that images are now being obtained, these rules of thumb will insure  that your images will be at a standard of quality that will produce sharp  images in print. Please work on obtaining images <i>in advance</i> of submitting the final version of your article to the  journal for publication so that they will be in proper format when the article  goes into production. </p>
			<h5><p><i>Camera-ready prints</i>.  Prints of artwork to be reproduced with your article should be supplied on  separate pages in camera-ready form. This includes manuscript and printed book  illustrations, photographs, hand-drawn figures or diagrams, maps, and anything  else that cannot be readily typeset. <i>Camera  ready</i> means high-contrast photographic reproduction on glossy paper, which  can be reduced and directly photographed and reproduced with a clear result.  Photocopies are not suitable for reproduction. Flaws on a glossy print will  show up in a published reproduction; therefore, do not attach anything to a  glossy surface with paper clip or staple, which can damage the surface of the  artwork and cause delays in obtaining a new print. On the back of each print,  attach a typed label with your name and identification of the figure. Protect  the artwork by placing it between pieces of cardboard.</p>
			<p><i>Digital images (a  picture or half-tone image)</i>. An electronic version of an image may be  submitted as an alternative to a print. The image should be either a TIFF or  EPS file, which are industry standards. As TIFF files are normally very large,  they often cannot be sent or opened in e-mail, and so it is best to submit them  on a CD. JPEG files, which are common on the Internet, are to be avoided  because they have poor compression&mdash;information lost to achieve compression of  smaller file size&mdash;and therefore can turn out blurry in printed form. And GIF  files do not have a high enough resolution to be usable. If your only  alternative is a JPEG file, do not <em>save  it as</em> a TIFF or EPS file; it is better for the press designers to work with  the original JPEG in such cases. Electronic images must be a minimum of 4.66  inches wide at a resolution of 300 dpi (1400 pixels wide). This minimum image  size will guarantee that the image will be sharp in printed form in the  journal. CAUTION: Do not take a small image off the Web and &ldquo;upsample&rdquo; it, or  blow it up, to 1400 pixels wide.That will <i>not</i> work at all, because such an image will be of an unacceptably low quality in  printed form. If, however, the Web image is 1400 pixels wide or wider, the  image would be useable. </p>
			<p><i>Line art (images such  as drawings, diagrams, or figures that contain only lines and no gray shading)</i>.  Line art must be, at minimum, 600 dpi and can be as high as 2,400 dpi; 900 or  1,200 dpi works for most pieces of line art. </p>
			<p>If all this technical information is befuddling, you can  consult the following Web resources that offer nonspecialist explanations:<br><a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/article_view.php?ID=199">http://www.istockphoto.com/article_view.php?ID=199</a><br>

			  Also, this information will be very familiar to your campus  technology support staff.</p>
			<p><i>Captions</i>. On a  separate sheet, include the caption copy to be used for each figure; this  includes the figure number, identification of the figure, and permission line.  Also include any directions for cropping. The text of the article should  clearly refer to each figure number when first introduced into the discussion.  Figures will appear in print near to the initial discussion of the image.</p>
			<p><i>Permissions for  reproduction</i></p>
			<p>As stated in the publication agreement, it is the author&rsquo;s  responsibility to obtain permission(s) for reproducing artwork. Most libraries  require this for material in their collections, particularly for special  collections materials. Permissions granting reproduction rights should be  included with the images and manuscript. If permissions are not provided by the  time an issue goes to press, artwork cannot be included. </p><p><a href="contributorGuidelines.html">return to top</a></p></h5>
