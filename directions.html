        The JMEMS search uses full-text database search capabilities.  The boolean full-text search capability supports the following
        operators:
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>
            <code class="literal">*</code>

          </p>
<p>
            The asterisk serves as the truncation (or wildcard)
            operator. Unlike the other operators, it should be
            <span class="emphasis"><em>appended</em></span> to the word to be affected.
            Words match if they begin with the word preceding the
            <code class="literal">*</code> operator.
          </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            <code class="literal">"</code>

          </p>
<p>
            A phrase that is enclosed within double quote
            (‘<code class="literal">"</code>’) characters matches only
            rows that contain the phrase <span class="emphasis"><em>literally, as it was
            typed</em></span>. 
            If the phrase contains no words that are in the index, the
            result is empty. 
          </p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
            <code class="literal">+</code>
          </p>
<p>
            A leading plus sign indicates that this word
            <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be present in each row that is
            returned.
          </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>

            <code class="literal">-</code>
          </p>
<p>
            A leading minus sign indicates that this word must
            <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be present in any of the rows that
            are returned.
          </p>
<p>
            Note: The <code class="literal">-</code> operator acts only to exclude
            rows that are otherwise matched by other search terms. Thus,
            a boolean-mode search that contains only terms preceded by
            <code class="literal">-</code> returns an empty result. It does not
            return “<span class="quote">all rows except those containing any of the
            excluded terms.</span>”
          </p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
            <code class="literal">&gt; &lt;</code>
          </p>
<p>
            These two operators are used to change a word's contribution
            to the relevance value that is assigned to a row. The
            <code class="literal">&gt;</code> operator increases the contribution
            and the <code class="literal">&lt;</code> operator decreases it. See
            the example following this list.
          </p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
            <code class="literal">( )</code>
          </p>
<p>
            Parentheses group words into subexpressions. Parenthesized
            groups can be nested.
          </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            <code class="literal">~</code>

          </p>
<p>
            A leading tilde acts as a negation operator, causing the
            word's contribution to the row's relevance to be negative.
            This is useful for marking “<span class="quote">noise</span>” words. A row
            containing such a word is rated lower than others, but is
            not excluded altogether, as it would be with the
            <code class="literal">-</code> operator.
          </p>
</li>

</ul></div>
<p>
        The following examples demonstrate some search strings that use
        boolean full-text operators:
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>
            <code class="literal">'apple*'</code>
          </p>
<p>
            Find rows that contain words such as “<span class="quote">apple</span>”,
            “<span class="quote">apples</span>”, “<span class="quote">applesauce</span>”, or
            “<span class="quote">applet</span>”.
          </p>

</li>
<li>
<p>
            <code class="literal">'"some words"'</code>
          </p>
<p>
            Find rows that contain the exact phrase “<span class="quote">some
            words</span>” (for example, rows that contain “<span class="quote">some
            words of wisdom</span>” but not “<span class="quote">some noise
            words</span>”). Note that the
            ‘<code class="literal">"</code>’ characters that enclose
            the phrase are operator characters that delimit the phrase.
            They are not the quotes that enclose the search string
            itself.
          </p>

</li>
<li>
<p>
            <code class="literal">'apple banana'</code>
          </p>

<p>
            Find rows that contain at least one of the two words.
          </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            <code class="literal">'+apple +juice'</code>
          </p>
<p>
            Find rows that contain both words.
          </p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
            <code class="literal">'+apple macintosh'</code>
          </p>
<p>
            Find rows that contain the word “<span class="quote">apple</span>”, but
            rank rows higher if they also contain
            “<span class="quote">macintosh</span>”.
          </p>
</li>
<li>

<p>
            <code class="literal">'+apple -macintosh'</code>
          </p>
<p>
            Find rows that contain the word “<span class="quote">apple</span>” but not
            “<span class="quote">macintosh</span>”.
          </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>

            <code class="literal">'+apple ~macintosh'</code>
          </p>
<p>
            Find rows that contain the word “<span class="quote">apple</span>”, but if
            the row also contains the word “<span class="quote">macintosh</span>”,
            rate it lower than if row does not. This is
            “<span class="quote">softer</span>” than a search for <code class="literal">'+apple
            -macintosh'</code>, for which the presence of
            “<span class="quote">macintosh</span>” causes the row not to be returned
            at all.
          </p>

</li>
<li>
<p>
            <code class="literal">'+apple +(&gt;turnover &lt;strudel)'</code>
          </p>
<p>
            Find rows that contain the words “<span class="quote">apple</span>” and
            “<span class="quote">turnover</span>”, or “<span class="quote">apple</span>” and
            “<span class="quote">strudel</span>” (in any order), but rank “<span class="quote">apple
            turnover</span>” higher than “<span class="quote">apple strudel</span>”.
          </p>

</li>
