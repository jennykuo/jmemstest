<span class="block">Microhistory first developed in the 1970s and 1980s to meet a particular set of challenges and problems in writing medieval and early modern history. This special issue of <i>JMEMS</i> will explore some of the ways in which microhistory has evolved since that time as it contests the usefulness of grand historical narratives for understanding historical problems where life was lived in fragmented, small-scale societies.  Submissions are invited that seek to illustrate some of the microhistorical practices that continue to evolve, especially in medieval and early modern contexts. Essays might focus on reducing the scale of analysis while "playing the ladder game" with different scales of analysis; working not just with clues, but also with silences and gaps in the evidence and with fragmented or incomplete understandings of events; blending social and cultural history by viewing culture as social action or lived and reflected experience; deploying more sophisticated textual frames of analysis from law, science, medicine, and other historical contexts; or examining innovations in narrative structure and storytelling. The aim of this special issue is to push the microhistorian's focus on small clues in the sources to face the dead ends, silences, and gaps that inevitably characterize microhistorical research.

<span class="block">For this open-topic issue of the journal, the editors invite articles that are both informed by historical inquiry and alert to issues raised by contemporary theoretical debate. We expect that essays will be grounded in an intimate knowledge of a particular past and that their argumentation reveal a concern for the theoretical and methodological issues involved in interpretation. We are particularly committed to work that seeks to overcome the polarization between history and theory in the study of premodern Western culture.

<span class="block">The second part of <i>Don Quijote</i> provides a rare example of early modern reflexiveness. The text famously comments upon its antecedent first part, its own decorum and verisimilitude, and the material circumstances of a text's production and translation. Its Muslim "second author" and Morisco "translator" also weigh in, multiplying the dizzying perspectives from which the text and its reading are assessed. Yet the 1615 <i>Quijote</i> is also remarkable for its sustained meditation on politics: the question of Sancho's class mobility and his obligation to his master; the spectacle of the Dukes' decadent excess and Sancho's experience as governor of their "&iacute;nsula" Barataria; the extended account of the exile from Spain of the Morisco Ricote and his family. The 1615 <i>Quijote</i> is, indeed, a highly political novel, similar to other key texts of Hapsburg Spain that took an active stance in ongoing conversations about the state of the country. As a result, Cervantes's choice of topics in this second part has had significant implications for contemporary readers, since some of its best-known episodes remain today as urgent as they were four hundred years ago. The debates on the legality of the expulsion of the Morisco communities from Spain in 1609 carried out by the Count of Sandoval resonate nowadays in a country in which "the Moor" has become a scapegoat for current crises, both at the local and national level--to the extent that the word <i>moro</i> is once again applied to a whole range of questionable behaviors. The opinions expressed by Don Quijote on the thorny issue of translation and "minor" vernacular languages in a city as highly charged with issues of bilingualism as Barcelona remains as timely as ever. If <i>Don Quijote II</i> is unquestionably a political book, a critical reading of it four hundred years after its publication is, inevitably, a political endeavor.<br><br>
 
We solicit essays that hone in on the intersection of these questions to think about the <i>politics of reading</i> in this second <i>Don Quijote</i>. How does the text's reflexiveness politicize reading itself? How does its constant awareness of reading and readers translate into a reflection on authority and power? How do the second part's material investments--its awareness of itself as a concrete, belated object--inform its conception of class and social organization? How, when, and why have some of its key questions, embodied in unforgettable characters and episodes, resonated over time?
